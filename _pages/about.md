I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Communication](https://comm.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, with a minor in Political Science. I'm advised by [Jennifer Pan](https://jenpan.com) and a [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/).

My research examines **journalism, propaganda, and media-state relations**—particularly in the context of China. I use computational methods combined with qualitative approaches to understand how authoritarian states shape global information flows and how journalists and citizens navigate censorship and political pressure.

Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a journalist based in Beijing, reporting for the *Los Angeles Times*, *Sixth Tone*, *ChinaFile*, and other outlets. This experience informs my scholarly interest in the practical challenges foreign correspondents face when covering authoritarian regimes.
